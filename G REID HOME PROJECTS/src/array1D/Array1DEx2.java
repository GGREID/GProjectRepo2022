2. Prompt the user for 10 integer values and store them in an array.  When they have 
finished, output all of the numbers and the total value.
3. Prompt the user for 10 integer values and store them in an array.  The program must 
compute and write how many integers are greater than or equal to 10. 
4. Prompt the user for 10 integer values and store them in an array.  Display "true" on 
the screen if there is an even number of even numbers among these 10. Otherwise, 
display "false". 
5. Read 10 integers from the keyboard, and store them in an array. For each integer in 
the array, display a line with that many "*" characters. 
6. Read in 10 integers from the keyboard, and store them in an array. Find the position 
(or index) of the maximum and minimum values in the array, and swap them (move 
the biggest element to the position of the smallest, and move the smallest element to 
the position of the biggest). 
7. Write a program that asks the user to type 10 integers of an array and an integer x. 
The program must search if x is in the array of 10 integers. The program writes "x is in 
the array" or "x is not in the array".
Update  the  program  to  remove  the  first  occurrence  of  x,  shifting  each  following 
element left and adding a zero at the end of the array. The program must then write 
out the final array. 
8. Write a program that asks the user to type 10 integers into an array. They should also 
enter an integer value x and an index value i between 0 and 9. The program must put 
the value x at the place i in the array. The program must then write out the final array.
9. Write a program which will enter 12 monthly rain figures and output total rainfall for 
year, average monthly rainfall, the month with highest rainfall and month with lowest 
rainfall.  
10. Write a program which will enter the name, quantity and price of 10 items of stock 
and calculate:
 The stock value for each item
 The overall stock value
 The average stock value
Output the names of those stock items which are below the average stock value.
11. Read in and store a list of 5 names and examination marks. 
Convert the marks to grades according to the following scheme: 
70 - 100: grade = ‘D’ (Distinction)
40 -   69: grade = ‘P’ (Pass)
  0 -   39: grade = ‘F’ (Fail)
Display the names with their corresponding marks beside them.
This program will require 3 arrays, one to hold the names, one to hold the marks, and 
one to hold the grades. 
Sample Output
Mickey Mouse 79 D
Donald Duck     43 P
