		/*EXERCISES
		1. Write and test a method hypotenuse that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right 
		angled  triangle  when  the  other  two  sides  are  given.  Use  this  method  in  a  program  to 
		determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the triangle shown below. This method 
		should take two double arguments and return the hypotenuse as a double.
		Triangle Side 1 Side 2
		1  3.0  4.0
		2  5.0  12.0
		3  8.0  15.00
		2. Write  and  test  a  method  multiple  that  determines  for  a  pair  of  integers  whether  the 
		second integer is a multiple of the first. The method should take two integer arguments 
		and return true if the second is a multiple of the first,  false otherwise. Use this method in 
		a program that inputs a series of pairs of integers.
		3. Write a program that inputs a series of integers and passes one at a time to a method even, 
		which uses the remainder (modulus) operator to determine whether an integer is even. 
		The method should take an integer argument and return true if the integer is even and 
		false otherwise.
		4. Write  and  test  a  method  that  displays  at  the  left  margin  of  the  screen  a  solid  square  of 
		asterisks whose side is specified in integer parameter side. For example, if side is 4, the 
		method displays the following:
		****
		****
		****
		****
		5. Modify  problem  4  to  form  the  square  out  of  whatever  character  is  contained  in 
		character  parameter  fillCharacter.    Thus,  if  is  side  is  5  and  fillCharacter  is  '#',  the 
		method prints:
		#####
		#####
		#####
		#####
		#####
		6. Implement the following integer functions:
		(a) Method celsius returns the Celsius equivalent of a Fahrenheit temperature
		(b) Method fahrenheit returns the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature.
		Use  these  functions  to  write  a  program  that  prints  charts  showing  the  Fahrenheit 
		equivalent of all Celsius temperature for 0 to 100 degrees and the Celsius equivalents of all 
		Fahrenheit temperatures from 32 to 212.
		7. Write a program that inputs three numbers and passes then to a method which returns 
		the smallest number.  The method should take decimal values as parameters.
		8. An integer is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its factors, including 1 but not the 
		number itself, is equal to the number. 
		For  example,  6  is  a  perfect  number  because  6  =  1  +  2  +  3.  Write  a  method  perfect  that 
		determines whether parameter number is a perfect number. Use this method in a program 
		that determines and prints all the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000. Print the factors 
		of each perfect number to confirm that the number is indeed perfect.
		9. An integer is said to be prime if it is divisible by only 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5 and 7 
		are prime but 4, 6, 8 and 9 are not.
		(a) Write a method that determines whether a number is prime.
		(b) Use  this  method  in  a  program  that  determines  and  prints  all  the  prime  numbers 
		between 2 and 10,000.
		10. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest integer that evenly divides 
		each of the numbers. Write a method gcd that returns the greatest common divisor of two 
		integers.
		11. Write a method qualityPoints that inputs a student's average and returns a 4 if a student's 
		average is 90 - 100, 3 if a student's average is 80 - 89, 2 if a student's average is 70 - 79, 1 
		if a student's average is 60 - 69, and 0 if the average is lower than 60.
		12. A parking garage charges £2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage 
		charges an additional £0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of the three 
		hours. The maximum for any given 24-hour period is £10.00.  Assume that no car parks 
		for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a program that calculates and prints the parking 
		charges for each of three customers who parked their car in this garage yesterday. You 
		should enter the hours parked for each customer. Your program should print the results in 
		a neat tabular format and should calculate and print the total of yesterday's receipts. 
		The program should create a method calculateCharges to determine the charge for each 
		customer. Your output should appear in the following format:
		Car  Hours Charge
		1 1.50    2.00
		2 4.00    2.50
		3         24.00    10.00
		  TOTAL      29.50      14.50*/
