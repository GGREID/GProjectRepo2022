/*EXERCISES
1. Write  a  program  that  creates  a  menu  for  the  user,  allowing  them  to  select  from  6 
options (with option 6 being Exit).  The program should output the option selected by 
the  user.    If  an  invalid  option  has  been  input,  the  program  should  output  an  error 
message.  
2. Create a program which takes in the day of the week (1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, etc) 
and prints out whether the day is a weekday (1-5) or a weekend (6-7).
3. Write a program which prompts the user to input an integer value.  Using a switch 
statement, print out the value in words if the amount is a valid sterling coin. If the 
integer value does not represent a valid coin, it should print out an error message 
“Invalid coin value: xx” (where xx is the value entered).
4. Write a program which prompts the user to input an integer value for the Month (1-
12).  Using a switch statement, print out the month name (January, February, etc...) 
and how many days are in the month. If the integer value does not represent a valid 
month  (1-12),  the  program  should  print  out  an  error  message  “Invalid  month:  xx” 
(where xx is the value entered). 
5. Write a program that takes two integers and a char representing one of the following 
mathematical  operations:  +,  -,  /,  or  *.  Use  a  switch  statement  to  perform  the 
appropriate  mathematical  operation  on  the  integers  and  output  the  result.  If  an 
invalid operator is input, the program should print “Error” and then end.
6. Enter  the  price  and  quantity  of  3  sale  items.    Total  up  the  cost  of  the  items  bought.
